# School-Museum

This project is the website of the school museum Gymnasium № 1 in Birobidzhan, Russia. It was created as a school project. My first project. Despite the very large number of mistakes, I am glad that I took it up.

## Technologies

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend.

## Usage

1. Open the website [link](https://museum-gymnasium1bir.netlify.app/) in your browser.
2. At the moment, I suggest you familiarize yourself with the main page, the `Архив/Символика и атрибутика`, `Деятельность музея`, `О нас/Где мы находимся`
